# Modeling-Stock-Prices-using-Black-Scholes-Model
modeled stock price behavior using the Black-Scholes model, which employs a type of log-normal distribution to represent the growth of the stock price.Conceptually, this representation consists of two pieces:
a) Growth based on interest rate only
b) Volatility of the market
Stock prices evolve over time, with a magnitude dependent on their volatility. The Black Scholes model treats this evolution in terms of a random walk.
